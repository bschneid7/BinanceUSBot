## Troubleshooting

### Build Warnings

During Docker build, you may see TypeScript warnings. These are non-critical and the application will function correctly. The TypeScript configuration has been relaxed to allow the build to complete.

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `.env.production`
2. **MongoDB connection failed**: Check MongoDB password in `.env.production`
3. **API errors**: Verify Binance API credentials

For more troubleshooting tips, see [DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Create admin user** using the seed script
2. **Log in** and change default password
3. **Configure bot settings** in the dashboard
4. **Test with small amounts** before full deployment
5. **Monitor logs** regularly
6. **Set up alerts** for critical events
7. **Review trading performance** daily
